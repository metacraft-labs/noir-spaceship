# Noir Spaceship
We are on a space ship, moving near light speed towards a distant planet. We are about to pass trough an asteroid field, changing the course is very expensive at this speed. We have to proove to everyone that we can survive the collisions.

We need to have at least 1 unit of shields left in order to survive the cosmic radiation. 

We can not reveal how much shields we have will have in the end so that the space pirates won't know if it is safe to atack us. The space pirates can track our course but our shield technology remains a well guarded secret.
